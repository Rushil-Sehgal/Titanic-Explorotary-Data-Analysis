# Titanic-Explorotary-Data-Analysis

#### In this repository, we have performed explorotary data analysis on the "Titanic" dataset. Here, we are trying to predict the "Survived" based on the other dependent variables.

#### The followed folder structure for this repository is as follows:
 
      -> src     : contains the Source files (.ipynb)
      -> data    : contains data related to the project (titanic.csv)
      -> result  : contains result of the project (e.g., plots, reports)
      -> doc     : contains documentation files (additional documentations)

##### The dataset details are mentioned below:

   **Column Description**
   
          PassengerId - Passenger Number
          Survived    - Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
          Pclass      - Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
          Name        - Name of Passenger
          Sex         - Gender of Passenger
          Age         - Age of Passenger
          SibSp       - Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
          Parch       - Number of Parents/Children Aboard
          Ticket      - Ticket Number
          Fare        - Ticket Price
          Cabin       - Cabin Number

   **Number of Columns**
          
          12
   
   **Number of records**
   
          891
      
### <ins>Performed Hypothesis</ins>

   **Determine if the survival rate is associated to the class of passenger**
   
        Checking the relationship between how many people survived based on the class of the passenger.
   
   **Determine if the survival rate is associated to the gender**
   
        Checking the relationship between the people survived to the gender of the people.
   
   **Determine the survival rate is associated to the age**
   
        Checking the relationship between the passengers survived based on their age.
